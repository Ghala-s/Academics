<p>The <a class="rec" href="https://csd.uwo.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Science Department</a> was established in 1964. In its early years, the department was small in terms of students, faculty, and number of courses offered. It also did not have a home base. It had several temporary homes, including the Stevenson Lawson building and the Engineering building, over the years but no permanent home until the department took residence in Middlesex College in the 1983.</p>

<p>Western is the first department in Canada and (we are pretty sure) in the world to have a female run the department! Dr. Irene Gargantini was the chair of the department from 1986 to 1991. She is enjoying her retirement and is now a mystery writer publishing books under pseudonym of Rene Natan.</p>

<h3><strong>Some other tidbits about Western's Computer Science Department include:</strong></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>
<p>We were originally part of the Physics Department until 1964.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>
<p>In the 1980s, there were only mainframe computers (1 big computer that shares its time amongst the users), so students had to come onto campus and wait their turns to get a terminal. Once they were seated at a terminal, they would log in and all their work would run on the mainframe. The terminal did nothing except send keystrokes to the mainframe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>
<p>Up until about 1982, students used punch cards. They would type (by punching) their programs onto the punch cards and then put the punch cards into a big reader. If the student made even one incorrect punch, they would have to repunch all the cards again. If they dropped the cards (it was similar to a deck of cards), they would have to retype them. Punch cards were very tedious to deal with and probably dissuaded some good programmers from continuing in Computer Science during that time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>
<p>In the 1980s, the programming languages that students learned in their first year were Pascal and Fortran. In the 2020s, students are learning Python and Java in their first year.</p>
